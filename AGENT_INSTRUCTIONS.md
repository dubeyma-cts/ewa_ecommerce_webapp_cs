- **Administrators** to manage the platform, sellers, and transactions

### Core Business Capabilities
1. **User Management** - Registration, authentication, profile management for Buyers, Sellers, and Admins
2. **Catalog Management** - 13+ product categories with search and filtering
3. **Auction System** - Time-bound bidding with automatic winner selection
4. **Direct Purchase** - Buy-now functionality bypassing auction
5. **Shop Management** - Seller storefronts with inventory management
6. **Payment Processing** - Multiple payment options (PayPal, Credit Card, Cheque, DD, COD)
7. **Order Fulfillment** - Dispatch tracking and delivery management
8. **Admin Controls** - Seller activation, transaction monitoring, rent payment tracking

### Non-Functional Requirements (Critical)
- **Availability:** 99.9% uptime, 24/7 operation, zero planned downtime
- **Performance:** p95 latency ≤3s UI pages, ≤500ms APIs, handle 10k concurrent sessions
- **Scalability:** Auto-scaling, handle heavy traffic load
- **Security:** TLS 1.2+, encryption at rest, MFA for Admin/Seller, RBAC
- **Maintainability:** Clean architecture, SOLID principles, comprehensive documentation

---

## System Requirements

### Technical Constraints

- **Cloud Provider:** Microsoft Azure
- **Database:** Azure SQL Database + Azure Cosmos DB (for high-throughput scenarios)
- **Container Orchestration:** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- **API Style:** RESTful APIs with OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- **Authentication:** Azure AD B2C with OAuth 2.0/OIDC

---

## Architecture Principles

### Microservices Design Principles
1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Each microservice represents a bounded context
2. **Single Responsibility:** One service per business capability
3. **Database per Service:** Each microservice owns its data store
4. **API Gateway Pattern:** Single entry point for all client requests
5. **Saga Pattern:** Distributed transactions with compensating actions
6. **Event-Driven Communication:** Asynchronous messaging for loose coupling
7. **Circuit Breaker:** Resilience patterns for failure handling
8. **CQRS:** Separate read/write models where appropriate (Catalog, Orders)

### Code Quality Standards
- **SOLID Principles:** Mandatory for all code
- **Clean Architecture:** Separation of concerns (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation)
- **Dependency Injection:** Use built-in .NET DI container
- **Async/Await:** All I/O operations must be asynchronous
- **Error Handling:** Global exception handling with structured logging
- **Code Coverage:** Minimum 80% unit test coverage per service
- **Code Reviews:** All PRs require 2 approvals minimum

---

## Development Guidelines

### Naming Conventions
- **Namespaces:** `EWA.{ServiceName}.{Layer}` (e.g., `EWA.Catalog.Domain`)
- **Projects:** `{ServiceName}.{Layer}` (e.g., `Catalog.API`, `Catalog.Domain`)
- **Classes:** PascalCase with descriptive names
- **Interfaces:** Prefix with `I` (e.g., `IProductRepository`)
- **Methods:** PascalCase with verb-noun pattern (e.g., `GetProductById`)
- **Variables:** camelCase for local, PascalCase for properties
- **Constants:** ALL_CAPS with underscores

### Git Workflow
- **Branch Strategy:** GitFlow (main, develop, feature/*, release/*, hotfix/*)
- **Feature Branches:** `feature/{ticket-id}-{short-description}`
- **Commit Messages:** `[{ServiceName}] {Type}: {Description}` (e.g., `[Catalog] feat: Add product search`)
- **Types:** feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore, perf
- **Pull Requests:** Must pass all CI checks, contract tests, and code reviews

### Logging & Monitoring
- **Structured Logging:** Use Serilog with JSON formatting
- **Correlation IDs:** Track requests across services
- **Log Levels:** ERROR (user-impacting), WARN (degraded), INFO (business events), DEBUG (dev only)
- **Metrics:** Application Insights for telemetry
- **Distributed Tracing:** 100% sampling for checkout, bidding, payment flows
- **Alerts:** Tied to SLOs (p95 latency, error rate <1%, uptime ≥99.9%)

### Error Handling
- **Global Exception Middleware:** Standardized error responses
- **Problem Details (RFC 7807):** Use for API error responses
- **Retry Logic:** Exponential backoff (100ms-2s×3) for transient failures
- **Circuit Breaker:** Polly library with appropriate thresholds
- **User-Facing Messages:** Generic errors, detailed logs in backend

### Before Starting
- [ ] Understand the business domain and requirements
- [ ] Review this document and relevant ADRs
- [ ] Understand service boundaries and dependencies
- [ ] Review API contract with dependent services

### During Development
- [ ] Follow Clean Architecture structure
- [ ] Implement SOLID principles
- [ ] Use dependency injection
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging with correlation IDs
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints
- [ ] Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] Write unit tests (80% coverage)
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Define and publish domain events
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully with retry logic
- [ ] Validate all inputs
- [ ] Add security headers and authentication

### Before Pull Request
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Code follows naming conventions
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or configurations
- [ ] Add/update README for service
- [ ] Update OpenAPI spec if API changed
- [ ] Run code quality analyzer (SonarLint)

## Service Communication Matrix

| Service | Depends On | Communicates Via |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| Identity.API | - | - |
| Catalog.API | Identity.API | HTTP (Auth) + Events |
| Auction.API | Identity.API, Catalog.API | HTTP + Events |
| Order.API | Identity.API, Catalog.API, Auction.API, Payment.API | HTTP + Saga (Events) |
| Payment.API | Identity.API | HTTP + Webhooks |
| Shop.API | Identity.API, Catalog.API | HTTP + Events |
| SellerAccount.API | Identity.API, Payment.API | HTTP + Events |
| Notification.API | (All services) | Events (Consumer) |
| Admin.API | Identity.API, SellerAccount.API, Order.API | HTTP |
| Search.API | Catalog.API, Shop.API | Events (Index sync) |
| Gateway.API | (All services) | HTTP Proxy |

## API Gateway Route Configuration

```
GET    /api/auth/*          → Identity.API
GET    /api/users/*         → Identity.API
POST   /api/auth/*          → Identity.API

GET    /api/categories/*    → Catalog.API
GET    /api/products/*      → Catalog.API
POST   /api/products/*      → Catalog.API (Seller)

GET    /api/auctions/*      → Auction.API
POST   /api/auctions/*      → Auction.API

GET    /api/orders/*        → Order.API
POST   /api/orders/*        → Order.API

POST   /api/payments/*      → Payment.API
GET    /api/payments/*      → Payment.API

GET    /api/shops/*         → Shop.API
POST   /api/shops/*         → Shop.API

```

## Event-Driven Architecture

### Event Publishing (Service Bus Topics)

| Event | Published By | Subscribed By |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| `UserRegistered` | Identity.API | Notification.API |
| `ProductCreated` | Catalog.API | Search.API, Auction.API |
| `ProductUpdated` | Catalog.API | Search.API |
| `InventoryChanged` | Shop.API | Catalog.API, Notification.API |
| `AuctionStarted` | Auction.API | Notification.API |
| `BidPlaced` | Auction.API | Notification.API |
| `AuctionEnded` | Auction.API | Order.API, Notification.API |
| `OrderCreated` | Order.API | Notification.API, Catalog.API |
| `PaymentCompleted` | Payment.API | Order.API, Notification.API |
| `OrderDispatched` | Order.API | Shop.API, Notification.API |
| `SellerActivated` | SellerAccount.API | Shop.API, Notification.API |
| `RentDue` | SellerAccount.API | Notification.API |

## Database Schema Guidelines

### Naming Conventions
- **Tables:** PascalCase, plural (e.g., `Users`, `Products`, `Orders`)
- **Columns:** PascalCase (e.g., `FirstName`, `CreatedAt`)
- **Primary Keys:** `Id` (int/guid)
- **Foreign Keys:** `{Entity}Id` (e.g., `UserId`, `ProductId`)
- **Indexes:** `IX_{TableName}_{ColumnName}`
- **Constraints:** `CK_{TableName}_{ColumnName}` (check), `FK_{TableName}_{ForeignTableName}` (foreign key)

### Audit Columns (All tables)
- `CreatedAt` (datetime2) - When record was created
- `CreatedBy` (nvarchar) - User who created
- `UpdatedAt` (datetime2) - Last update timestamp
- `UpdatedBy` (nvarchar) - User who last updated
- `IsDeleted` (bit) - Soft delete flag
- `DeletedAt` (datetime2) - Deletion timestamp
- `RowVersion` (rowversion) - Optimistic concurrency

### Performance Optimization
- Index frequently queried columns
- Avoid N+1 queries (use eager loading)
- Partition large tables (Orders, Audit Logs)
- Archive old data (>1 year to cold storage)
